# Models of Data Processing - ETL/ELT

This chapter introduces interns to the two primary models of data processing: **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**. Interns will implement a simplified ETL pipeline using Python scripts to simulate real-world data workflows.

## ‚úÖ To Do List

- [ ] Run extraction scripts to collect data from all three sources.
- [ ] Use transformation scripts to clean and model the data.
- [ ] Load the transformed data into PostgreSQL tables.
- [ ] Validate the pipeline by querying the final tables.
- [ ] Document the ETL process.

## üõ†Ô∏è ETL Pipeline Breakdown

### üîç Extract

Data is extracted from three different sources and stored in the raw layer of the data warehouse.

'internit_data'
To extract data for internit_data table use the code from 'src/extract/internit.py' file.

'exchange_data'
To extract data for exchange_data table use the code from 'src/extract/exchange.py' file.

'xe_data'
To extract data for xe_data table use the code from 'src/extract/xe.py' file.

### Transform

Data is cleaned, normalized, and structured into analytical models such as dimensions and fact tables.

To transform data for 'dim_currency', 'dim_rate', 'dim_user', and 'fact_transaction' tables use the code from 'src/transform/transformer.py' file.

### Load

Transformed data is loaded into the trusted layer of the internit_db warehouse for reporting and analytics.

To load data from 'staging' to 'trusted' layer use the code from 'src/load/loader'.py file.
